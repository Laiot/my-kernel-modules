# my-kernel-modules
In this repo I will store my experiments writing Kernel modules in Rust, based on the [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

Please read the [Quick Start](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/rust/quick-start.rst) document before getting started with kernel development in Rust.
